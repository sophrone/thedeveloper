        <p>
          I began my journey in web development out of curiosity, a desire to create beautiful and functional websites and a way to challenge myself.
          With a background in music production, I utilized my creativity and translated it into web development, which was not an easy feat, but I welcomed the challenge and did it!

          I really believe in the importance of continuous learning and growth. The web development landscape is ever-changing, 
          and I embrace new challenges with enthusiasm and a drive to always better myself. Collaboration and communication are key components of my work ethic.
